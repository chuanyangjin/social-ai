# Social-AI Position Paper

The position paper [Advancing Social Intelligence in AI Agents: Technical Challenges and Open Questions](link) discusses core technical challenges, opportunities, and open questions towards building socially-intelligent AI (Social-AI) agents. Our paper is anchored in social intelligence concepts and progress in Social-AI across 6 computing communities: natural language processing, machine learning, computer vision, robotics, human-machine interaction (including human-computer interaction and human-robot interaction), and speech. This repository of resources will be continually updated with additional community resources.
