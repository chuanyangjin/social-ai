This is a repository of papers, books, courses, benchmarks/challenges, and dissertations related to the multimodal and multidisciplinary goal of advancing socially-intelligent AI (Social-AI) agents. This repository accompanies the position paper [Advancing Social Intelligence in AI Agents: Technical Challenges and Open Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11023).


# Social-AI Position Paper

The position paper [Advancing Social Intelligence in AI Agents: Technical Challenges and Open Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11023) discusses a set of core technical challenges, along with opportunities and open questions, towards advancing socially-intelligent AI (Social-AI) agents situated in diverse social contexts. Our paper is anchored in social intelligence concepts and progress in Social-AI across 6 computing communities: natural language processing, machine learning, computer vision, robotics, human-machine interaction (including human-computer interaction and human-robot interaction), and speech. Social-AI research interest has accelerated across computing communities in recent years:

  <em>Cumulative number of Social-AI papers over time, based on the 3,257 papers from our Semantic Scholar Social-AI queries. Interest in Social-AI research has been accelerating across computing communities.</em>
</p>

We believe there are core technical challenges that must be addressed to advance Social-AI, relevant to Social-AI research across the landscape of social contexts:

<p align="center">
  <img src="challenges.png" style="width: 60%;">

  <em>(A) Four core technical challenges in Social-AI research, illustrated in an example context of a Social-AI
agent observing and learning from a human-human interaction. (B) Social contexts in which Social-AI agents can
be situated, with interactions spanning social units, interaction structures, and timescales. Interactions can span
social settings, degrees of agent embodiment, and social attributes of humans, with agents in several roles.</em>
</p>

**C1: Ambiguity in Constructs**

*Social constructs have inherent ambiguity in their definition and interpretation in the social world.* Opportunities and open questions to address this challenge are discussed in Section 4.1 of the paper.

**C2: Nuanced Signals** 

*Social constructs are expressed through behaviors and signals that can be nuanced, often manifesting through different degrees of synchrony across actors and modalities. During interactions, small changes in social signals can lead to large shifts in social meaning being conveyed.* Opportunities and open questions to address this challenge are discussed in Section 4.2 of the paper.

**C3: Multiple Perspectives** 

*In social interactions, actors bring their own perspectives, experiences, and roles; these factors can change over time and influence the perspectives of other actors during interactions.* Opportunities and open questions to address this challenge are discussed in Section 4.3 of the paper.

**C4: Agency and Adaptation**

*Actors learn from social experiences and adapt to social contexts, through interactions, influenced by their own agency, goals, motivations, and identities.* Opportunities and open questions to address this challenge are discussed in Section 4.4 of the paper.

### Social Intelligence Competencies

We consider the following 6 competencies to be core competencies of social intelligence: **Social Perception, Knowledge, Memory, Reasoning, Creativity (Theory-of-Mind), Interaction**. This perspective is informed by social intelligence research, such as perspectives from [Weis and Süß 2005](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=iJibEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA203&dq=Social+intelligence–a+review+and+critical+discussion+of+mea-+surement+concepts&ots=5Z-v4dX9md&sig=rmwUlZAY5P0vUCUhgHZ87doi3yA#v=onepage&q=Social%20intelligence–a%20review%20and%20critical%20discussion%20of%20mea-%20surement%20concepts&f=false), [Weis 2008](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=a34ce5d809e7858130961f64a957060a80423749), [Conzelmann, Weis, and Süß 2013](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1614-0001/a000106?journalCode=jid), and additional readings on social [interaction](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=bjkTxML-wpEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=Handbook+of+Symbolic+Interactionism+%222003%22+%22mccall%22&ots=01b92DQaDg&sig=EbDP7BMlpEsGElM8D1BuLpKdPnM#v=onepage&q=Handbook%20of%20Symbolic%20Interactionism%20%222003%22%20%22mccall%22&f=false), among others. The study and identification of social intelligence competencies is an ongoing research area across cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience. We will continually update this repository with new findings, and please feel free to add any additional resources below.

## Dimensions of Social Context, Additional Concepts, and Frameworks
Social-AI agents can be situated within interactions spanning social units, interaction structures, and timescales. Interactions can span social settings, degrees of agent embodiment, and social attributes of humans, with agents in several roles.
